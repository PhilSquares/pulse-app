# ⚡ Pulse

**Pulse** is a full-stack workflow & goal tracking platform built with **Angular 21** and **Spring Boot 3**.

Modern productivity tools are either too simple to model real workflows or too complex for personal use. Pulse aims to provide a **flexible, structured system** for tracking goals, projects, and execution across both technical and non-technical domains.
